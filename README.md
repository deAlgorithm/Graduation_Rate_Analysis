# Graduation Rate Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset on students' graduation rates and their influencing factors such as ACT scores, SAT scores, parental education, parental income, high school GPA, and college GPA. The objective of this analysis is to identify patterns and trends in the data to understand the factors affecting graduation rates.

## Data Description
The dataset used for analysis consists of various attributes related to students' academic performance and parental background. It comprises records across multiple columns, including ACT composite score, SAT total score, parental level of education, parental income, high school GPA, college GPA, and years to graduate. The dataset provides comprehensive insights into the factors influencing students' graduation rates.

## Tools Used
The tools used for this analysis are:
- Python (including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

## Analysis and Insights
From the imported dataset, the dataframe consists of the following columns:
- `ACT composite score`
- `SAT total score`
- `parental level of education`
- `parental income`
- `high school gpa`
- `college gpa`
- `years to graduate`

### Key Insights:
- **Correlation Analysis:** The correlation matrix helps identify the relationships between different numeric variables.
- **Distribution Analysis:** Histograms and box plots visualize the distribution of various numeric attributes.
- **High School GPA vs. College GPA:** A scatter plot highlights the relationship between high school GPA and college GPA.
- **Impact of Parental Education:** Box plots show how different parental education levels affect students' academic performance and graduation time.

## Conclusion
### Summary of Findings
1. **Correlation Analysis:** Certain factors such as parental income and high school GPA show strong correlations with college GPA and years to graduate.
2. **Distribution Trends:** The distributions of ACT scores, SAT scores, and GPAs provide insights into the academic performance of the student population.
3. **Parental Influence:** Parental education and income significantly impact students' academic success and graduation timelines.

### Implications
- **Educational Support:** Insights can help educational institutions identify students who might need additional support based on their backgrounds.
- **Policy Making:** Policymakers can use this data to create programs aimed at improving graduation rates by addressing key influencing factors.

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements and Analyses
1. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Develop predictive models to forecast students' graduation rates based on their academic and parental backgrounds.
2. **Detailed Segmentation:**
   - Perform deeper segmentation to identify specific student personas based on their academic performance and parental background.
3. **Longitudinal Study:**
   - Extend the analysis to include longitudinal data to understand how students' academic performance evolves over time.
4. **Intervention Strategies:**
   - Propose targeted intervention strategies to help students who are at risk of delayed graduation or poor academic performance.
